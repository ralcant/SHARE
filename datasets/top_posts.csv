This is the dirty joke my 85yo grandad told to our whole family by memory,"A male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they noticed a whaling ship.  The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, ""Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. 

Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."" At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. ""Look,"" she said, ""I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen."" 

Edit: I think it's bad that I'm more excited watching this get ups that I was about the whole of Christmas ","A father whale and his son are swimming when the son whale asks his father ""where did I come from.""

So the monocle hops off the bar stool and grabs his cigarettes to head outside. Meanwhile a second monocle emerges from the bathroom. They bump into each other as they cross paths and fall to the floor, hopelessly entangled. They try to get free but the more they struggle, the more tangled they become.

My favorite joke: Everyone Knows Dave,"Dave was bragging to his boss one day, ""You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them.""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it.""
So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

 ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. 

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.
After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope.""
He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'","I've never heard of this joke before. But before clicking this, I knew it was good old Dave you were referring to."

"Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam.","His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... 

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note.  People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  Words cannot do justice to the experience.  The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday.  All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note.  From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted!  The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  Soon the entire monastery was aflame.  By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""





- EDIT - Wow, I came back and this really blew up!  Thanks so much for the kind comments, and upvotes, and gold.  I'm so glad I could give so many people a chuckle today!  ",This is probably the best original joke I've read on this sub.
[Serious] Just a reminder to be careful when telling jokes that may be offensive.,"A few days ago I was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.

I decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.

Here's the joke I told:

""What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?

Throw your washing (laundry if you're American) in.""

One of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.

Obviously I felt mortified as I didn't know about it, and said ""I'm so sorry to hear that. Did he drown?""

""No,"" replied the guy. ""He choked on a sock.""", The real joke is me thinking this was an anecdote.
"As a butcher is shooing a dog from his shop,he sees a $10 and a note in his mouth, reading: ""5 lamb chops, please.""","As a butcher is shooing a dog from his shop,he sees a $10 and a note in his mouth, reading: ""5 lamb chops, please.""
Amazed, he takes the money, puts a bag of chops in the dog's mouth,and quickly closes the shop.
He follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, and
trot across the road to a bus-stop.
The dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench.
When a bus arrives, he walks around to the front and looks at the number, then boards the bus.
The butcher follows, dumbstruck.
As the bus travels out into the suburbs, the dog takes in the scenery.
After awhile he stands on his back paws to push the ""stop"" bell,
then the butcher follows him off.
The dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the step.
He goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -Whap!- against the door.
He does this again and again. No answer.
So he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window,
jumps off, and waits at the front door.
A big guy opens it and starts cursing and shouting at the dog.
The butcher runs up and screams at the guy: ""What the hell are you doing?
This dog's a genius!""
The owner responds, ""Genius, my ass.........
It's the second time this week he's forgotten his keys!""","Reminds of this dog joke:

A guy is driving around the back woods and he sees a sign in front of a broken down, shanty-style house: **Talking Dog For Sale.** He rings the bell and the owner appears and tells him the dog is in the backyard.

The guy goes into the backyard and sees a nice looking Labrador retriever sitting there.

""You talk?"" he asks. 

""Yep,"" the Lab replies. 

After the guy recovers from the shock of hearing a dog talk, he says ""So, what's your story?""

The Lab looks up and says, ""Well, I discovered that I could talk when I was pretty young. I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA. In no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping.

""I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years running. But the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger so I decided to settle down. I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded a batch of medals.

""I got married, had a mess of puppies, and now I'm just retired.""

The guy is amazed. He goes back in and asks the owner what he wants for the dog. 

""Ten dollars,"" the guy says.

""Ten dollars? This dog is amazing! Why on earth are you selling him so cheap??""

""Because the dog's a damn liar. He never did any of that shit.""

\-----------------------

Edit: Since this blew up I won't change anything, but if I told it again I would change the dog's first reply from ""yep"" to something like ""sure do"" - I think it works a little better. If you're creative this joke is perfect for expanding; adding more stories to the dog's tale I bet bolsters the punchline. "
A mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up,"So, he opens the box and picks up the letter.  He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters.  When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail.  He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.

A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from.  He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address.  Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient.  He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up.  He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it.  The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

*Ding-dong, ding-dong.  Ding-dong, ding-dong.  Ding-dong, Ding-dong.*

The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.

“Pardon me, sir,” the mailman says, “but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.”

“Ah, my letter.  Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated.  Please do so again” replies the Buddhist monk.

“But sir,” says mailman, “you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.”

“But that is my intention, dear man,” replies the Buddhist monk.  “You see, reposting is the best way to get karma.”

The C.E.O says ""I'll be a waiter. All you do is carry food back and forth. This'll be a breeze"" so he is teleported to a restaurant. After about an hour, all the annoying customers drive him insane, so he smashes his plates on the ground and gives up.

The mosquitoes fall silent for a brief moment. ""My God, you're right. We didn't think about the economy! Very well, we will not attack this dimension. FOR THE TAXPAYERS!"" and with that, they vanish.

""Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!""

A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. 

Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. 

The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

The Queen's breasts,"Once upon a time there lived a beautiful Queen with large breasts.


Sid, the Dragon Slayer, obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death, should he try to touch them, but he had to try.


One day Sid revealed his secret desire to his colleague, Nathan


the Erudite lawyer, the King's chief adviser. Nathan thought about this and said that he could arrange for Sid to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause, Sid readily agreed to the scheme.


The next day, Nathan got a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense.


Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Nathan informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and Nathan advised that only the saliva of Sid would work as the antidote to cure the itch.


The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Sid to their chambers. Nathan then slipped Sid the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Sid worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Sid left satisfied and hailed as a hero.


Upon returning to his chamber, Sid found Nathan demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Sid couldn't have cared less knowing that Nathan could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.


The next day, Nathan slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Sid.","I wasn't disappointed , thank you"

Johnny walked up and sat on Santa’s lap and said “Santa, for Christmas I want a god damn new baseball bat and I want it to be put under my god damn bed.  I want a god damn new baseball glove, and I want it put under the god damn Christmas tree.  And Santa, I want a god damn new bike and I want it put under a god damn tarp in the god damn shed.”

Santa, in complete shock, pulled Little Johnny’s parents aside and said “In all my years, I have never seen a little boy with such a foul mouth.”

His parents replied “We know, but we have no idea what to do about his behavior.  We’ve tried everything.”

Santa thought about it and said “Here’s what we’ll do to teach him a lesson, every place that Johnny asked for a present, we’ll put a pile of dog poop.”  The parents agreed to try Santa’s plan.

On Christmas morning, Little Johnny woke up and immediately looked under his bed.  Seeing the pile of poop, he ran downstairs to the Christmas tree and checked underneath.

Finding another pile of poop under the tree, he ran out the door and threw open the shed door.  

Finding a tarp in the shed, he quickly pulled back the tarp and found yet another pile of poop.

Johnny walked out of the shed and started looking all around the yard.  After a while his parents asked him sarcastically “So Little Johnny, what did you get for Christmas?”

Without missing a beat, Johnny looked at his parents and said “I think I got a god damned dog, but I can’t find the motherfucker!”

______________________________________________________

PART 1: THE PARTY

A wealthy but stingy father was preparing a birthday party for his 18 year old daughter. He wanted the party to be extravagant, but wanted to spend as little money as possible. He had finished all of the other decorations, and he was left to work on the cake.

""Why not get it ordered from an upscale bakery?"" his wife said.

""Why do you do this for free? You should take money for your services!""

PART 2: For the Horny Redditors

At the party, impressed by both the monk's cooking skills, along with his manners and good looks, that she approached the monk, hoping to develop a friendship with him. They were quick to develop chemistry, and the girl's feelings evolved into love for the monk, who was close to her age.

One day, the girl was dying to know if her feelings would be reciprocated, so she invited the monk over to her house.

When he reached there, he was met by a beautiful woman in equally beautiful lingerie, and the girl professed her undying love for the monk.

""I know you're probably a virgin, and that having sex is against your religion, so I understand if you don't feel the same,"" she said.

Knowing that the monk would never give up the chance at Nirvana to be with her, she looked crestfallen until the monk took her to her bed and said,

""I've lived my life a horny virgin. I love you, but losing my virginity means I'm going to have to lose an essential part of myself.""

""You don't mean you'll give up being a monk for me?"" she said.

""What?"" the monk asked, very surprised.

""No, now that I'm no longer a horny virgin, I have to delete my Reddit account.""

PART 3: The Monk Goes Home

I'm the type of person to finish what they start, and when yesterday people told me they wanted more monk jokes I wanted to experiment with how this would work. Tell me if you want more!

The monk enjoyed the remainder of his time with the family, and he too had fallen in love with her. With a heavy heart, he promised to return and went home to resume his prayers.

When he reached his monastery, he was greeted by he Abbot, who said,

""Ah, my son. Come inside. How was your trip?""

The monk replied, ""I was able to help a family for their daughter's birthday by baking them a splendid cake.

""Wonderful!"" the Abbot exclaimed.

But a couple of weeks passed by and the monk felt more and more guilty about having sex with his love.

One day, he went to the Abbot to tell him of his deed, hoping to find forgiveness for his sin.

""Abbot, I need to confess to you. When I was gone, I slept with a girl and broke my vow of celibacy.""

The monk tried to circle back, saying, ""I did pleasure the girl, so should that earn me karma?""

The Abbot was silent and the monk bowed his head in shame, waiting for a scolding.

The Abbot, in his eternal wiseness, softly asked, ""Did you only sleep with the girl for karma?""

He spoke, ""I hope you didn't, cause not everyone likes a karmawhore."

The best joke I’ve ever heard which never fails to make me smile whenever I remember it.(NSFW),"
Three explorers get lost in a huge jungle. After wandering around for days, they are found and captured by a jungle tribe. The tribesmen take the explorers to their leader and drop them at his feet. The chieftain looks at them for a moment and says, “ The three of you will die unless you manage to do a near impossible task. Each of you must gather 10 fruits of the same kind and bring them to me.”
The explorers cannot believe their luck at being given such an easy task. They set out their separate ways to find a fruit as fast as they can. The first one finds an apple tree and so quickly gathers 10 of them. The second one finds some cherries and plucks a bunch of them.They rush to the chieftain and present the fruits. The chieftain smiles and says, “ Now you must shove them up your ass one by one, and if you make any noise or facial expression I will slit your throat right here.”
The first explorer,resigned to his fate, puts on a brave face and starts shoving the apples. He gets to four and then he can’t take it anymore. As soon as he yells in despair, the chieftain takes his knife and slits his throat leaving him to bleed out on the ground.
The first explorer dies and reaches the gates of heaven, and while he is walking in he sees the second explorer running to catch up with him. “Why are you here? I thought you only had ten small cherries with you?” The first guy asks him.
The second explorer laughs and says “ Well all was going fine and I was just sliding the ninth cherry inside, but then I saw our friend dragging a cart of the largest pineapples have seen behind him and I burst out laughing!”","In Indian version, it was jackfruit - the fruit with thorny surface."

Buddy and Edna agreed and up they went.

A gorilla dies of old age at a zoo right before the zoo opens.

Quickly, the new ""gorilla"" becomes the most popular craze at the zoo. People from all over are coming to see the ""Human-like"" gorilla.

"Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community...","If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.

The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.

However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other

The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

The Rabbi pulled out an apple.

With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!

Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue!'

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi. 'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'","The rabbi was an avid golfer and played at every opportunity. He was so addicted to the game that he would get withdrawal symptoms if he didn't play. One Yom Kippur the rabbi thought to himself, ""What's it going to hurt if I go out during the recess and play a few rounds. Nobody will be the wiser, and I'll be back in time for services."" 

Sure enough, at the end of the morning service, the rabbi snuck out of the synagogue and headed straight for the golf course. Looking down upon the scene were Moses and God.  Moses said, ""Look how terrible -- a Jew on Yom Kippur. And even worse! A rabbi!""

God replied ""Watch. I'm going to teach him a lesson."" 

The rabbi stepped up to the first tee. When he hit the ball, it careened off a tree, struck a rock, skipped across a pond and landed in the hole for a hole in one!

"Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community...","If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.

The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.

However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other

The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

The Rabbi pulled out an apple.

With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!

Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue!'

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi. 'He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!'","The rabbi was an avid golfer and played at every opportunity. He was so addicted to the game that he would get withdrawal symptoms if he didn't play. One Yom Kippur the rabbi thought to himself, ""What's it going to hurt if I go out during the recess and play a few rounds. Nobody will be the wiser, and I'll be back in time for services."" 

Sure enough, at the end of the morning service, the rabbi snuck out of the synagogue and headed straight for the golf course. Looking down upon the scene were Moses and God.  Moses said, ""Look how terrible -- a Jew on Yom Kippur. And even worse! A rabbi!""

God replied ""Watch. I'm going to teach him a lesson."" 

The rabbi stepped up to the first tee. When he hit the ball, it careened off a tree, struck a rock, skipped across a pond and landed in the hole for a hole in one! 

Seeing all this, Moses protested. ""God, is this how you're going to teach him a lesson? He got a hole in one!"" 

""Sure,"" said God, ""but who's he going to tell?"" "

"Hey girl, are you a cop?",... because you’ve taken my breath away.,"Joke so dark, the cops shot it"
Two boys in Egypt free a crocodile...,"In a small village in Egypt lived two orphan boys, Set and Amenhotep. They always watched out for each other, well past their years of childhood and into their time as young adults.

One day, the two were walking outside the village when they saw a crocodile trapped in a poacher’s snare. The two young men, sympathetic to a creature in need, approached the crocodile and released it from the trap.

Once freed, the crocodile transformed into a wispy, glowing fairy! “Thank you, young men” said the fairy, “Your hearts are truly selfless, and I will grant each of you one wish. What are your names?”

“This is my friend Set, and you can call me ‘Ep’”, said Amenhotep.

“Very well, Ep” said the fairy “What is the desire of your heart?”

“I wish I was the strongest man in the world!” Amenhotep wished. 

“Very well”, said the fairy, “but you must always use your strength to help others.” Smoke gathered around Amenhotep, and when the smoke cleared Ep was 7 foot six and rippling with muscles. 

The fairy turned to Set “And what is your wish, Set?”
Set responded “I never want to be poor again! I wish for money!”

“Very well,” said the fairy. Smoke gathered in front of the two of them, and when the smoke cleared a small elf remained, bowing to the two boys. “Greetings, sirs! My name is Elmon, and I am here to serve!”

“Elmon is an expert in all things money,” said the fairy, “He will help you make wise decisions and turn any business profitable, but will only help you so long as he is only asked to do good for your fellow man.”

Amenhotep and Set were inseparable. True to his word, Amenhotep used his great strength to build many houses for people in need. Set helped, as well, but his comparatively small size next to the now massive Amenhotep earned him the nickname “Imp”. With Elmon’s financial savvy, the two started a non-profit dedicated to building houses for the less fortunate, and Elmon kept all their paperwork in perfect order.  

Years passed, and the two lived very fulfilling lives helping the homeless. Amenhotep met a girl while building houses and the two got married and had a beautiful baby boy, Josep. 

Ep and Set’s business expanded globally. 15 years passed and Amenhotep grew kinder and more generous, giving to people in need at any of the places he went to build houses. Set built a campus in Cairo for the headquarters of their business, and directed global efforts. Over the years, Set lost touch with the people he was helping, and became more focused on business expansion and money of the business. 

As all fathers do, Amenhotep wanted his son to eventually take over the business and help the next generation of needful people find purpose in their lives. He sent Josep to the the HQ in Cairo to learn business from Set. Once there, Josep was surprised to find that much of the financial success was due in large part to the financial savvy of Elmon, the elf.

Josep spent months at HQ learning how to run the business. While there, Set decided that it was time to expand the company into a more profitable venture. Instead of building houses for the needy, he drafted up a plan to buy up land around urban areas and construct rental properties at expensive prices while preventing construction of new, affordable housing. He sent Josep with the proposal to Elmon to determine the financial logistics.

Upon reading the proposal and its ill-nature’s effect on Set’s fellow man, Elmon keeled over and died, instantly.

Josep was shocked, and ran to alert Set right away, who wailed in dismay at the loss of his financial mastermind. In a rage, he accused Josep of killing Elmon, and sent the teenager to jail.

Amenhotep, hearing of the distress, caught the first flight back to Cairo to find himself neck-deep in a legal battle between him and his old friend.

Without the financial and legal savvy of Elmon, Set’s case was a mess. Amenhotep, distraught, tried to reason with his childhood friend. “Come, Imp, release my boy and call off the lawsuit. Let’s use our energy to help those in need and not further what we both know is a fruitless path.”

Set refused, furiously gathering circumstantial evidence to bring to the court to frame Josep for Elmon’s murder.

The case was brought before the court, but Set’s claims were weak and unsupported. The judge, thoroughly disgusted with the lack of evidence from the prosecution, dismissed the case outright.

Obviously, Ep’s teen didn’t kill Imp’s elf.",That must have been a long crocodile.

"While picking up a turkey for this Thanksgiving, I overheard this gem.","A lady was picking through the frozen turkeys, but she couldn't find one big enough for her family.

She asked a stock boy, ""Do these turkeys get any bigger?""

The stock boy replied, ""No ma'am, they’re dead.""","Reminds me of when I used to sell pet food.

I had just finished getting through my whole spiel and the lady asked me

“So is it really that good?” (It was, not just saying that cuz I worked for them)

And I responded without thinking

“I don’t know, I haven’t eaten it.”

Thankfully she laughed and bought an extra bag.



Edit for the people asking why the food is good:

All but two of Earthborn's ingredients are made in the United States, the lamb comes from New Zealand and the fish comes from Thailand. However it is important to note that Thailand actually has higher health standards on fish than the United States and also allows American inspectors into their facilities at any time. None of the food contains any by-product whatsoever, almost all of the formulas are grain free barring a few specialty formulas that have things like barley or rice in them for dogs with sensitive digestive tracts (looking at you German Shepards). All of the materials used in the bags & containers for the wet food are 100% recyclable. Also, you can sign up at their website to get an email every month with coupons so that you never have to pay full price for a bag. They have a wide range of ingredients in their different formulas, which is nice for dogs who don't like to eat the same thing for too long. This way you can switch up their food but keep within a brand you know offers a high quality formula. Earthborn also does all their own manufacturing and storage; this way Earthborn is only ever around other Earthborn before it's put on shelves. Earthborn has also never had a recall. They also have a partnership with UPCs for Trees and have planted almost 500,000 trees via the program.

There was this tramp.,"One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.

Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.

Coincidentally the father drives up. ""How can I ever thank you sir?"" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. ""Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.""

""Ah, well..."" stammers the tramp, ""... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.""

""Oh dear,"" says the father, ""I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.""

""No! No!"" says the tramp, ""Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.""

""Ten pounds,"" thinks the tramp, ""I'm rich! I'm rich!"" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.

He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. ""I'll have one holiday please!""

""Ahem, which holiday would sir like?"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.

""Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,"" replies the tramp.

""TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,"" says the girl incredulously.

She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.

""Well you'll never believe it,"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. ""I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.""

""Yippee!"" exclaims the tramp, ""I'll take it!""

A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.

""Get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.

""But I've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!""

""Well okay,"" says the captain, ""but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.""

So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.

""Psst,"" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.

""Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.""

The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!

First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6"" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.

Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep, and so on...

3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.

""Sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""A room of my very own.""

""I'm glad you like it,"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.""

Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...

Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.

He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...

... and what a dive...!

Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.

Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.

""That was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""Where did you learn to dive like that?""

""Um, well I've never actually dived before,"" replied the tramp.

""Well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""I've never seen..."" He broke off. ""Hey, I've got an idea"", he started again. ""How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""

""It's a deal!"" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.

Then one morning the captain comes to talk. ""Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.""

""Okay,"" agreed the tramp.

Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.

""Well, tramp,"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""Let's see what you can do."" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...

up and up...

below him the ship grew smaller...

on and on...

past a solitary albatross...

and still higher...

till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...

and on still further...

hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,

Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,

""I CAN SEE HIM!"" yelled a passenger, ""LOOK!!!""

The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...

NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!

DOWN THROUGH THE WATER!

SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!

DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!

SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!

DOWN!

SMASH!

Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.

Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.

Up and up, desperate, gasping...

Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.

""HERO!"" ""WONDERFUL!"" ""AMAZING!"" ""GOOD SHOW THAT!""

And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.

""Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.""

The tramp blushed.

The captain went on, ""but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""

And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: ""Well you see...

""For me to tell you, I'll need $49.95""

The captain outrageously asked why.

The tramp said

It was a beautiful ceremony, however I did find some things strange. For instance, the priest never said, ""You may now kiss the bride"", but I just assumed it was purely an American thing and didn't mind.

Later during the reception, we were both starving and decided to head over to the buffet to get food. On the way we passed the drink table, where about six people were waiting to get a fruity drink from a bowl.

As we passed, they all said in unison, ""You may now kiss the bride!"" My wife got giddy and gave me a big kiss, which I of course returned.

As we walked away I asked, ""Why did *they* tell us to kiss and not the priest?""

My wife answered,

Donald thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil opened the door to the first room.

In it was Barack Obama and a large pool of water. Barack kept diving in, and surfacing, empty handed. Over, and over he dived in and surfaced with nothing. Such was his fate in hell.

""No,"" Donald said. ""I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and it would ruin my hair.

A man's fence is broken and he neess to hire someone to fix it,"So he goes online to find someone to fix his fence for him but he is unsatisfied with their prices, that is until he finds a Buddhist monk who will do it for free.

He is initially surprised by this and assumes it might be a fake listing, but since it's free he feels like he has nothing to lose so he hires him.

Sure enough a few days later the monk shows up with a toolkit in hand, the man shows the monk that his fence has been ripped out of the ground and that he needs to replace it.

About an hour later the monk walks in and tells the man he is finished, and when the man goes outside he sees that the fence is perfect, thinking he can't just tell the monk to leave after doing such a great job for free he invites the monk inside for a cup of coffee.

The man then starts talking to the monk, ""It surprised me to see a monk offering services for fence repair, why do you do it?"" he asked

the monk replied ""Religious reasons.""

The man then says ""I don't know much about Buddhism, why do you need to repair fences?""

""Because"" the monk replied, ""You would be surprised at the amount of karma you get for reposting.""

Gay Couple on a Plane,"A gay couple (Jeremiah and Timothy) is traveling on a plane. 

""What if we had sex?"" asks Jeremiah.

""Are you crazy? Here, on the plane? It would be awkward, everyone would watch us doing it...""

""Nobody is even paying attention to anything. Look!""

Jeremiah stands up and asks loudly:

""Could I have a napkin, please?""

Nobody gives a damn. Everyone is sleeping, reading, looking out the window, etc.  Flight attendants pretend to not hear them, as they also don't give a damn.

""They really wouldn't care then, would they?"" says Timothy.

So Jeremiah and Timothy have wild sex on the plane.

Later, when the plane arrives to the airport and the people are leaving, the stewardess sees an old man who threw up all over his shirt, even his pants are soaking in the filth.

""Sir, you should've asked for a bag!""

""I didn't dare"" whispers the old man. ""A few rows ahead I saw a man asking for a napkin and he got fucked in the ass...""",This one’s a keeper!
"A policeman was interrogating 3 guys who were training to become detectives. To test their skills in recognizing a suspect, he shows the first guys a picture for 5 seconds and then hides it. ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?""","

The first guy answers, ""That's easy, we'll catch him fast because he only has one eye!""

The policeman says, ""Well...uh...that's because the picture I showed is his side profile.""

Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second guy and asks him, ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?""

The second guy smiles, flips his hair and says, ""Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!""

The policeman angrily responds, ""What's the matter with you two?!!? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?""

Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third guy and in a very testy voice asks, ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?

He quickly adds, ""Think hard before giving me a stupid answer.""

The third guy looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, ""The suspect wears contact lenses.""

The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not.

""Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that.""

He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file on his computer and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.

""Wow! I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does, in fact, wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?""

""That's easy..."" the third guy replied. ""He can't wear regular glasses because he only has one eye and one ear.""","Was waiting for ""why didn't you catch him when you took the photo"""

She's very pleasant and a gracious winner.

They invite her back again, but each man harbors a burning desire to beat her.

The third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys.

This week she plays right-handed and narrowly beats all three of them.

The men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part.

However, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play, they can't hold a grudge.

This woman is a riddle no one can figure out.

They have a couple of beers in the Clubhouse and finally, one of the men asks her, ""How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?""

"4 years ago today, I shared the worst joke I ever created. Here it is again for those that missed it.","There are two identical twin brothers that live together. One happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job. Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted.  
  
About 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off.  
  
The dentist wakes to a knock on the door. Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak.  
  
The grim reaper swears. ""Oh no! This always happens with identical twins"".  
  
""What do you mean?"" asks the dentist.  
  
""Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now.""  
  
The dentist is noticeably upset. He says ""Wait! Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, YOU made the mistake. Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life.""  
  
The grim reaper asks ""What do you have in mind?""  
  
The dentist thinks. ""How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free.""  
  
The grim reaper laughs. ""I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose?""  
  
The dentist smiles. ""I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide.""  
  
""Very well"" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom.  
  
Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. ""You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance.""  
  
The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles.  
  
It's unbelievable.  
  
The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth.  
  
The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. ""You win, human. This time. Your brother will live."" He disappears in a puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. ""Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car. They say I almost died.""  
  
The dentist smiles on the phone and says. ""That's interesting, bro. Today you might say that I also had a brush with death.""",I can never get that time back

Once upon a time there lived a beautiful Queen with large breasts,"Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. 


One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. 


Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. 

The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. 

Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. 

Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.

Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.

The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.

A good (and very old) joke to explain why people are stocking up on necessities,"It was autumn, and the Indians on the remote reservation asked their new Chief if the winter was going to be cold or mild. Since he was an Indian Chief in a modern society, he had never been taught the old secrets.

When he looked at the sky, he couldn't tell what the weather was going to be. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he replied to his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared.

Also, being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, ""Is the coming winter going to be cold?""

""It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed,"" the meteorologist at the weather service responded. So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared.

A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. ""Is it going to be a very cold winter?""

""Yes,"" the man at National Weather Service again replied,""it's definitely going to be a very cold winter."" The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find.

Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again. ""Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?""

""Absolutely,"" the man replied. ""It's going to be one of the coldest winters ever.""

""How can you be so sure?"" the Chief asked.

The weatherman replied, ""The Indians are collecting wood like crazy.""

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""

Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,

A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon....,"A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest. 

After a moment or two, the vet 
shook his head and sadly said, ""I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away."" 

The distressed woman wailed, 
""Are you sure?""
""Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead,"" replied 
the vet.. 

""How can you be so sure?"" she protested. ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or 
something."" 

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later 
with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. 

The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat
back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room. 

The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck."" 

The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and 
produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..

The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$150!"" she cried, ""$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!""

The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, 
the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $150.""

Two rednecks flew to Canada on a hunting trip.,"  

 They chartered a small plane to take them into the Rockies for a week hunting moose.   
 

They managed to bag 6. As they were loading the plane to return, the Pilot said the plane could take only 4 moose.   
 

The two guys objected strongly. ""Last year we shot six. The pilot let us take them all and he had the same plane as yours.""   
 

Reluctantly, the pilot gave in and all six were loaded. The plane took  off. However, while attempting to cross some mountains, even on full power, the little plane couldn't handle the load and went down.   
 

Somehow, surrounded by the moose bodies, only the two rednecks survived the   
 crash.   
 

After climbing out of the wreckage, Billy Ray asked Billy Bob, ""Any idea where we   
 are?""   
 

Billy Bob replied, ""I think we're pretty close to where we crashed last year.""","There was a Scotsman visiting Canada for the first time. He was being driven by an acquaintance through the woods when a moose ran across the road in front of the vehicle. 

The Scotsman exclaimed, “What was that?!”

The driver replied, “It’s just a moose.”

“Yes, he did,” she replied sweetly.

With a smile on his face, the cop says ""Well, next year, tell Santa to put a taillight on that bike,” and he proceeds to hand the girl a $20 ticket.

Before the cop rides off she says ""By the way, that's a nice horse you got there. Did Santa bring that to you?""

Playing along the cop says, ""Yeah, he sure did.”

“Well, next year, tell Santa the dick goes underneath the horse, not on top.”","A man is sitting in a new sports car when a little girl pulls up beside him on her new bicycle she just received for Christmas. She knocks on his window, which he rolls down to see what she wants.

""Wanna race, mister?"" she asks, ringing her bell and twirling the elastic streamers on her handlebars.

""Sure,"" the man laughs. The light turns green and he floors the pedal. The car takes off like a shot and he leaves the little girl in the dust.

A few seconds later though, he sees something gaining on him in his mirror, *fast.* He just barely catches a glimpse of the little girl on her bike as she shoots past him. ""She must be going 80 miles per hour!"" he shouts, and shifts into a higher gear, pushing the car even faster.

He quickly blasts past her as if she were standing still. But again, just a few seconds later, she shoots past him, now doing over a hundred miles an hour on her little bike. Going so fast, sparks and smoke are streaming from her training wheels.

After another few seconds, he comes to a curve where he sees the little girl crashed in a heap on the side of the road. He pulls over and jumps out to see if she's okay. Miraculously she's survived. So he asks, ""Why did you go so fast?""

Just as she falls unconscious, the little girl replies, ""my streamers got caught on your mirror!"""
The first female president,"
The year is 2028 and the United States has elected the first woman as well as the first Jewish president, Sarah Goldstein.

She calls up her mother a few weeks after Election Day and says, ""So, Mom, I assume you'll be coming to my inauguration?""

""I don't think so. It's a ten-hour drive, your father isn't as young as he used to be, and my arthritis is acting up again.""

""Don't worry about it, Mom, I'll send Air Force One to pick you up and take you home. And a limousine will pick you up at your door.""

""I don't know. Everybody will be so fancy-schmantzy; what on earth would I wear?

Sarah replies, ""I'll make sure you have a wonderful gown, custom-made by the best designer in New York.""

""Honey,"" Mom complains, ""you know I can't eat those rich foods you and your friends like to eat.""

The President-to-be responds, ""Don't worry Mom. The entire affair is going to be handled by the best caterer in New York; kosher all the way Mom, I really want you to come.""

So Mom reluctantly agrees and on January 20, 2029, Sarah Goldstein is being sworn in as President of the United States. In the front row sits the new President's mother, who leans over to a senator sitting next to her and says, ""You see that woman over there with her hand on the Torah, becoming President of the United States?""

The senator whispers back, ""Yes, I do.""

Mom says proudly, ""Her brother is a doctor.""

“There’s a simple trick you can try to determine her hearing” explains the doctor. “Simply ask her a question at a distance and if she doesn’t hear you, move slightly closer and ask again until she does”.

That night, the husband arrives home and sees his wife in the kitchen cooking. He thinks to himself, “what a perfect opportunity to test her hearing”.

“What’s for dinner honey?”

No answer. He moves closer.

My best friend Jimmy Spitz and I told our parents we were sleeping at each others' houses, snuck out, took a bus into the city and saw them play at the Plain Dealer Pavillion!"" Naturally, they're both shocked. 

""If that isn't weird enough,"" says the woman, ""I noticed you're reading Mark Twain. I was a communications major in university and I actually wrote my thesis on Mark Twain, how he used satire as a lens to comment on current events of the time, comparing him to satirical news sources of today. He's my favourite author""

Now the man is really taken aback, ""Get out of here. I was an English major in university! I specialized in 19th century American literature, this is like my fourth or fifth time reading Tom Sawyer, I absolutely love Mark Twain.""

They both can't believe it, this has got to be a match made in heaven. 

""Ok,""  the woman says, ""well, buckle up because here's the icing on the cake. I noticed you're eating a prune. Prunes are my absolute favourite fruit. When I was a kid, my grandfather lived on a farm. He had an orchard that mainly grew apples and some lemons, but he knew how much my sister and I loved prunes so he kept a couple of plum trees. Every year at the end of the summer, we'd go up and harvest the plums with him. He'd dry them and by the time we'd go back to his place for Thanksgiving he'd always have those prunes saved just for us. They're my favourite fruit! I love prunes, you're eating a prune, this has got to be fate. What do you say?""

The man puts down his fruit and responds, 

*""It's a date.""*",That punchline was so good I stopped going to setlist to see if Maiden played Cleveland in '99

Afternoon Sex,"The only way to pull off a Sunday afternoon ""quickie"" with their 8-year-old son in the  apartment was to send him out on the balcony with a Popsicle and tell him to report on  all the neighbourhood activities.
“There's a car being towed from the parking lot,"" he shouted.

""An ambulance just drove by!""
""Looks like the Andersons have company,"" he called out.

    ""Looks like the Sanders are moving!""
    ""Jason is on his skate board!""

Satisfied with the privacy, he undid his pants and started to wank.
He closed his eyes and thought of his lover. As he grew closer to the big finish, he felt a quick tug at the bottom of his pants.

Not wanting to lose his mental fantasy or the orgasm, he kept his eyes shut and replied, ""What?""

He heard, ""This is the police. What's going on down there?""

My late Grandfathers favorite joke,"There was an American wrestler from Texas named John, who throughout his high school career had never lost a match. As he went on into college he continued undefeated. He became a national icon and symbol of American strength.

News began to circulate of a Russian wrestler who was fierce and unstoppable. As each wrestlers legends grew, a match was set up between the two, America versus Russia. The match would be held in Texas.

John began training immediately. Every day his coach would tell him, “This Russian has a move called the Mongolian Death Grip. No one has ever escaped the Mongolian Death Grip. DO NOT let him get you in the Mongolian Death Grip”

The day of the match finally came. Just before each wrestler stepped onto the mat in front of the capacity crowd, the coach once again said, “Whatever you do, do not let him get you in the Mongolian death grip. No one has ever escaped the Mongolian death grip”. 

Four seconds into the match, the Russian had the American in the Mongolian death grip. The coach buried his face into his hands and cursed John for not listening to his advice. All of the sudden he heard the crowd irrupt in a chant of USA USA USA. He looked up and saw the Russian pinned by John. The coach ran out to meet John and embarrassingly told him, “I didn’t see... Once he had you in the Mongolian Death Grip I looked away. How in the world did you get out of the Mongolian death grip?”

With heavy breath, John told him “Well coach, that Russian grabbed me and twisted my body in ways I never imagined possible. I was wincing in pain when I open my eyes and right in front of me were two testicles. So I bit them.”

“What???” Said the coach... “John I don’t think that is legal. You could be disqualified”

“I don’t know about that coach. But I can tell you one thing. You ain’t got no idea how strong you are until you bite your own balls”

There's a little-known legend about Attila the Hun...,"The story goes that Attila used to collect exotic animals that he found during his conquests. He particularly liked dangerous or fearsome animals, and his favourite was a giant snake. He was so fond of it, it was said that he brought it with him on every campaign.


But his snake lost its appetite, and soon stopped eating altogether; perhaps due to the stress of frequent travel and an irregular diet.


Wishing to save his prized pet, Attila sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. None of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins.


Attila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a Christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet.


But the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent. Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.


Standing before Attila, the old man calmly said, ""Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me.""


Curious, Attila did as he asked.


Then the old man took some bread and gave it to Attila.


""Now hold these in both hands,"" he instructed.


Attila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.


To an amazed Attila, the old man simply said,


""Thy anaconda don't want nun unless you've got buns, Hun.""",That buildup was golden.

One day we were taking lots of eggs to the market in a basket on the front seat of the truck when we hit a big bump in the road. The basket fell off the seat and all the eggs broke.” The moral of the story is not to put all your eggs in one basket. “Very good,” said the teacher. Next, Mary said, “We are farmers too. We had twenty eggs waiting to hatch, but when they did we only got ten chicks.” The moral of this story is not to count your chickens before they’re hatched . “Very good,” said the teacher again, very pleased with the response so far.

Next it was Barney’s turn to tell his story: “My dad told me this story about my Aunt Karen. Aunt Karen was a flight engineer in the war and her plane got hit. She had to bail out over enemy territory and all she had was a bottle of whiskey, a machine gun and a machete.” “Go on,” said the teacher, intrigued.

“Aunt Karen drank the whiskey on the way down to prepare herself. Then she landed right in the middle of a hundred enemy soldiers. She killed seventy of them with the machine gun until she ran out of bullets. Then she killed twenty more with the machete till the blade broke. And then she killed the last ten with her bare hands.” “Good heavens,” said the horrified teacher, “What did your father say was the moral of that frightening Story?”

A Marine returns from duty in Iraq and is immediately reassigned to a remote location in Afghanistan.,"That evening he arrives at his new post; a run down mosque in the middle of nowhere.

As he switches over with the marine currently stationed there, he realises there is no bed, no clean water, no toilet, just him, his weapon and the dirt on the floor.

The next morning he wakes up to find a queue of naked men leading into the mosque. At the front, the mosque leader is in prayer with the man leading the line.

As the prayer finishes, he drops to his knees and swings his fist into the naked guys balls, flooring him! The naked guy slowly comes to his senses and crawls out of the mosque.

Confused, the marine asks the mosque leader what's going on...

""These men are thieves, rapists and murderers from all over Afghanistan."" He says, ""Instead of prison, their punishment is to walk through the desert in nothing but their sandals, receive Allah's justice, then return home.""

The marine returns to his post and continues to watch these unusual punishments.

Simultaneously, every mathematician opens their mouth and out pours a cloud of multicolored mosquitoes. Each mathematician is bellowing insects of a different shade.

The mosquitoes form into a singular, polychromatic swarm. ""FOOLS"" it booms in unison, ""I WILL INFECT EVERY BEING ON THIS PATHETIC PLANET WITH MALARIA""

The bartender stands fearless against the technicolor hoard. ""But wait"" he inturrupts, thinking fast, ""if you do that, politicians will use the catastrophe as an excuse to implement free healthcare. Think of how much that will hurt the taxpayers!""

The mosquitoes fall silent for a brief moment. ""My God, you're right. We didn't think about the economy! Very well, we will not attack this dimension. FOR THE TAXPAYERS!"" and with that, they vanish.

He then walks up to the boyfriend and hands him the beer and sandwich and says ""Here, I was next door at Mrs.Johnson's house stuck in that position for 2 days and no one gave me anything to eat.""

"A man drives a train in Bulgaria. One day, he falls asleep driving and runs over someone walking on the tracks. Well, his case goes to court, and he gets the death sentence for murder","So, he’s on death row and the executioner approaches him.

“What would you like for your last meal?”

“I would like a banana please.”

The executioner thinks it’s weird, but shrugs and gives him a banana. The guy eats his banana, waits a while, and gets strapped into the electric chair.

When the flip the switch, nothing happens! In Bulgaria, such an act of divine intervention means you get released.

A few months go by, and the train driver has been working for a new company. Well, old habits die hard, and he falls asleep again, killing 2 people this time. The court has no patience for recklessness, so he ends up on death row again. After a while, the same executioner from last time approaches him.

“You again? Dang! What do you want this time?”

“Two bananas please.”

The executioner shrugs and hands him two bananas. A bit weird, but whatever. There’s no way he can cheat death twice! But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again. The train driver walks a second time.

Some time passes, and the executioner is very busy. After another few months, the same dude shows up, apparently having run over 3 people with a train. Exacerbated, the executioner approaches him for the third time.

“Let me guess. Three bananas?”

“Actually yes! How did you know?”

“Too bad! This has gone on long enough. No more bananas! Today you fry.”

So, the train driver gets strapped into the chair with no last meal. But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again.

“I don’t get it,” says the executioner. “I didn’t let you eat any bananas!”

“It’s not the bananas.” Sighed the prisoner. “I’m a very bad conductor.”",This joke really amped up my ire.

**Teacher:** Possibly so, in colloquial speech. Discerning context can help us decipher the nuance of each sentence on a case-by-case basis. However, as your teacher, my task is to teach you the intricacies and nuances of the English language with rigor, so that you may have a greater mastery of the language in order to effectively and precisely control what you want to communicate. In this case, the difference between the words ""can"" and ""may"".

**Student:** Point taken. May I borrow a pencil?

**Teacher:** No, you may not. The state cut funding for education again.","I wanted to marry my English teacher when she got out of jail.

They walk on and the area gets even nicer. There are birds chirping, squirrels running around, kittens everywhere.
They arrive at a fountain, where the most beautiful woman the atheist has ever seen sits on a bench. She looks at him and they instantly fall in love with each other. The man couldn´t be any happier. The devil says ""Everyone gets to have their soulmate down here, we don´t want anyone to be lonely!""

As they walk on, the atheist notices a high fence. He peeks to the other side and is totally shocked. There are people in pools of lava, screaming in pain, while little devils run around and stab them with their tridents. Other devils are skinning people alive, heads are spiked, and many more terrible things are happening. A stench of sulfur is in the air.

Terrified, the man stumbles backwards, and asks the devil ""What is going on there?""

English to become the official European language,"The European Commission has just announced an agreement whereby English will be the official language of the European Union rather than German, which was the other possibility.

"Jack, a renown atheist, dies...","... and to his utter surprise ends up in hell where he's greeted by Satan himself.

Completely shocked he talks to the devil and says: ""Welp, I've been wrong all my life and I guess I'm now to pay the price for my lack of faith""

Satan laughs and replies: ""Awh it's not so bad down here, let me give you the tour so you can see for yourself""

He then proceeds to escort Jack through a beautiful lush green plain with flowers, scattered here and there there's a bunch of houses where other ""damned"" live.

As they pass through each house the inhabitants recognize Satan and invite them inside for a drink and a chat, request that's always granted by the two.

Every time they stop to a house Satan never fails to display how much of a lovely guy he really is by telling amazing stories, singing, cracking jokes and just generally being a great person.

At sunset the devil sees that Jack was very tired and decides to show him the house he'll be spending the rest of eternity into.

As they walk to Jack's new house the two pass close to a huge wall and Jack asks: ""What's behind there?""

Satan: ""Oh, nothing that should concern you, pay it no mind""

Despite his curiosity Jack thought better not to bother Satan with further questions and just followed him to his new house where Satan promised he'd be back the following morning to show him the recreational center before finally bidding him a goodnight after a long day.

That night however Jack kept thinking back at the whole situation he's in and how surreal everything was until his thoughts eventually jumped to the wall he saw earlier in the day.

After a few minutes trying to guess what could there be behind that wall that Satan couldn't even tell him he decided he should investigate, as such he took a deep breath and dived into the night walking back to the place where the wall was.

Once there he searched for some clues until he saw some faint light coming from a spot in the wall; upon closer inspection he saw that there was a hole and the light was coming from behind the wall.

Jack took a deep breath and scrounged up the courage to look into the crack on the wall and what he saw was a spectacle much alike what he always thought hell would be.

On the other side of the wall huge flames were scattered all over a burnt and scalding hot ground and much to his horror he saw other souls inside that nightmare being eternally burned and never consuming, screaming and pleading for help.

Jack rushed back into his place where he just quietly sobbed and cried all night for he was sure now that the Devil was just toying with him to give him a bit of hope right before tossing him into eternal despair.

The following morning Satan showed up once again and told Jack to come with him.

Jack pleaded: ""PLEASE! PLEASE! Don't take me to hell, I'll do anything just let me stay here, I don't wanna burn for all eternity!""

Satan: ""What are you talking about??? I'm just gonna show you the recreational center like I told you yesterday""

Jack: ""Don't lie to me, I saw what was going on behind the giant wall!""

Satan: ""Ooooh you saw that! Don't worry  that's not for you, that's the Christian hell""

Jack: ""The christian hell? Why would the christian hell be like that?""

Satan: ""I don't know either man, they just want it that way""

"A teacher goes for a long walk on the beach. She finds a shiny magic lamb, picks it up, and rubs it.","There is a puff of blue smoke and a genie pops out. “You have three wishes. I can give you anything in the world. If I fail, I must become your personal genie for eternity.”

The teacher thinks for a moment and says, “For my first wish, I want jewels. Silver, gold, platinum, whatever you have.”  Poof! The jewels appear. 

“For my second wish, I want karma. Lots of karma.” Poof! The karma appears. 

The genie stares at the teacher, waiting for the third wish. “I can give you anything in the world,” he says again. 

The teacher thinks for a long time. “As a teacher, I always hated careless mistakes from my students. I noticed that I accidentally wrote ‘lamb’ instead of ‘lamp.’ Please correct my mistake.”

The genie moaned in anguish. “This is Reddit,” he shouted. Once you post it, you can’t edit the title.

Man wakes up in a slum with no memory of how he got there.,"He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""

Once upon a time there lived a ravishing Queen with huge tits..,"Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. 

One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. 

Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. 

The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. 

Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. 

Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.

Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.

The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.

""Best day? Well, that must've been the day that Old Man Jones asked me for help. You see, his pretty little wife had wandered out and gotten lost in the bayou. So we put together a search party and went looking for her. Just before sundown, we found her...""

This is great, thinks the reporter.

"".. and then we all fucked her. Best damn day of my life.""

""Holy shit,"" yells the reporter, ""that's terrible. I can't print that. Here, have another drink, and tell me about the second-best day of your life.""

""Second-best, huh? That might've been the day Jim Bob's prize hog broke out of its pen and got lost in the bayou. He was mighty attached to that hog, so we put together a search party and went looking. Just before sunset we found it. Then, we all fucked it. Not as great as Mrs. Jones, but pretty damn good.""

""Damn it, man, I can't possibly print that story,"" says the reporter despairingly. He decides on a different tack. ""How about another drink, and you tell me about the worst day of your life?""

Hillbilly's face falls. ""Worst day of my life? Well, that had to be the day I got lost in the bayou...""","The bayou giveth, the bayou taketh away"

At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy whether he would like the 3-pack, 10-pack or family pack. Boy picks the family pack because he thinks he will be really busy since it is his first time.

The boy shows up at the girl's house and she takes her to the dinner table where her family is sitting. The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head.

The boy whispers back"" I had no idea your father was a pharmacist!'",The fact that there is a “family” pack of condoms is concerning for multiple reasons.

A perfectly triangular lake has 3 kingdoms on its 3 sides,"A perfectly triangular lake has 3 kingdoms on its 3 sides. The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people, the second is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power. The third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.


The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and a few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. 


The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. 


In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and swings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight. 


The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom. 


And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

""Hey Mister! If I can guess how many sheep you have, may I keep one?""

The shepherd has hundreds of sheep and feels confident enough to agree.  The redhead looks over the flock and says, ""361.""  The shepherd is stunned that she guessed correctly but, being a man of his word, allows her to pick out her favorite.  The redhead is about to put her new pet in her car when the shepherd calls out to her. 

""Hey Lady! If I can guess your real hair color, may I have my dog back?""

&nbsp;

My sister was not amused.","A shepherd was herding his flock in a remote pasture when suddenly a brand-new
BMW advanced out of the dust cloud towards him. The driver, a young man in a
Brioni suit, Gucci shoes, Ray Ban sunglasses and YSL tie, leaned out the window
and asked the shepherd, ""If I tell you exactly how many sheep you have in
your flock, will you give me one?""

The shepherd looked at the man, obviously a yuppie, then looked at his peacefully-grazing
flock and calmly answered, ""Sure.""

The yuppie parked his car, whipped out his lap top and connected it to a cell
phone, then he surfed to a NASA page on the internet where he called up a GPS satellite navigation system, scanned the area, and then opened up a database
and an Excel spreadsheet with complex formulas.

He sent an e-mail on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, received a response.
Finally, he prints out a 150 page report on his hi-tech miniaturized printer
then turns to the Shepherd and says, You have exactly 1586 sheep.""

""That is correct; take one of the sheep."" said the shepherd.

He watches the young man select one of the animals and bundle it into his
car.

Then the Shepherd says: "" If I can tell you exactly what your business
is, will you give me back my sheep?""

""OK, why not."" answered the young man.

""Clearly, you are a consultant."" said the shepherd.

""That’s correct,"" says the yuppie, ""but how did you guess
that?""

""No guessing required."" answers the shepherd. ""You turned up
here although nobody called you. You want to get paid for an answer I already
knew, to a question I never asked, and you don’t know crud about my business.

""Dear, Dad.

It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you.

I had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mom and you.

I've been finding real passion with Stacy.

She is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight motorcycle clothes and because she is so much older than I am.

But it's not only the passion, Dad.

She's pregnant.

Stacy said that we will be very happy.

She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter.

We share a dream of having many more children.

Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone.

We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.

In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Stacy can get better.

She sure deserves it!

Don't worry Dad, I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself.

Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.

Love, your son, Joshua.

P.S. Dad, none of the above is true.

I'm over at Jason's house.

I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the school report that's on the kitchen table.

John decided to go skiing with his buddy, Keith. So they loaded up John's minivan and headed north. 

After driving for a few hours, they got caught in a terrible blizzard. So they pulled into a nearby farm
and asked the attractive lady who answered the 
door if they could spend the night. 

'I realize it's terrible weather out there and I have
this huge house all to myself, but I'm recently widowed,' she explained. 'I'm afraid the neighbors 
will talk if I let you stay in my house.' 

'Don't worry,' John said. 'We'll be happy to sleep in 
the barn. And if the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light.' The lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and settled in for the night. 

Come morning, the weather had cleared, and they 
got on their way. 
They enjoyed a great weekend of skiing.

But about nine months later, John got an 
unexpected letter from an attorney. It took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally determined 
that it was from the attorney of that attractive widow he had met on the ski weekend. 

He dropped in on his friend Keith and asked, 'Keith, 
do you remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at on our ski holiday up north about
9 months ago?' 

'Yes, I do.' Said Keith.

'Did you, er, happen to get up in the middle of the night, go up to the house and pay her a visit?' 

'Well, um, yes!,' Keith said, a little embarrassed 
about being found out,'I have to admit that I did.' 

'And did you happen to give her my name instead of telling her your name?'

Keith's face turned beet red and he said,
'Yeah, look, I'm sorry, buddy. I'm afraid I did.' 'Why 
do you ask?' 


She just died and left me everything.'

Tom's scrotum," The pastor asked if anyone in the congregation would like to express praise for answered prayers.

Suzie Smith stood and walked to the podium.

She said, ""I have a praise.

Two months ago, my husband, Tom, had a terrible bicycle wreck and his scrotum was completely crushed. The pain was excruciating and the doctors didn't know if they could help him.""

(You could hear a muffled gasp from the men in the congregation as they imagine the pain that poor Tom must have experienced.)

""Tom was unable to hold me or the children,"" she went on, ""and every move caused him terrible pain.""

We prayed as the doctors performed a delicate operation, and it turned out they were able to piece together the crushed remnants of Tom's scrotum, and wrap wire around it to hold it in place.""

(Again, the men in the congregation cringed and squirm uncomfortably as they imagined the horrible surgery performed on Tom.)

""Now,"" she announced in a quivering voice, ""thank the Lord, Tom is out of the hospital and the doctors say that with time, his scrotum should recover completely.""

(All the men sighed with unified relief.)

The pastor rose and tentatively asked if anyone else had something to say.

He said, ""I'm Tom Smith."" The entire congregation held its breath.

"In a crowded city at a bus stop, a beautiful young woman was waiting for the bus. She was decked out in a tight leather mini skirt, with matching tight leather boots and jacket...","

As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step on the bus.

 Slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the bus driver, she reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little, thinking that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg. 

Again, she tried to make the step onto the bus, only to discover she still couldn't! 

So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached behind and unzipped her skirt a little more and for a second time attempted the step and once again, still she could not raise her leg because of the tight skirt. 

With a coy little smile to the driver, she again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again was unable to make the step.

About this time, a big Texan that was behind her in the line picked her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the step of the bus. 

Well, she went ballistic and turned on the would-be hero screeching at him, ""How dare you touch my body!! I don't even know who you are!""

At this, the Texan drawled, ""Well ma'am normally I would agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda figured that we was friends.""","This is my 92 yo grandma’s favorite joke!

A policeman was interrogating 3 guys who were training to become detectives.,"To test their skills in recognizing a suspect, he shows the first guys a picture for 5 seconds and then hides it. ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?""

The first guy answers, ""That's easy, we'll catch him fast because he only has one eye!"" The policeman says, ""Well...uh...that's because the picture I showed is his side profile.""

Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second guy and asks him, ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?""

The second guy smiles, flips his hair, and says, ""Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!""

The policeman angrily responds, ""What's the matter with you two?? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?""

Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third guy and in a very testy voice asks, ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him? He quickly adds, ""Think hard before giving me a stupid answer.""

The third guy looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, ""the suspect wears contact lenses.""

The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not. 

""Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that."" He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file on his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.

""Wow! I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does, in fact, wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?""

""That's easy,"" the third guy replied."" He can't wear regular glasses because he only has one eye and one ear.""","The fact that the first two guys flip their hair implies this started life as a blonde joke.

"Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community...","If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.

The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.

However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other.

The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head.

 The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

The Rabbi pulled out an apple.

With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. 

The Jews could stay in Italy!

Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened.

 The Pope said, ""First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs. Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He bested me at every move and I could not continue!""

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 

""I don't have a clue!!!"" the Rabbi said.

""First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger. Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here.""

""And then what?"" asked a woman.

 ""Who knows!!"" said the Rabbi. ""He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!""",I first saw this joke over 35 years ago in the ‘Big Book of Jewish Humor.’

It was a beautiful ceremony, however I did find some things strange. For instance, the priest never said, ""You may now kiss the bride"", but I just assumed it was purely an American thing and didn't mind.

Later during the reception, we were both starving and decided to head over to the buffet to get food. On the way we passed the drink table, where about six people were waiting to get a fruity drink from a bowl.

As we passed, they all said in unison, ""You may now kiss the bride!"" My wife got giddy and gave me a big kiss, which I of course returned.

As we walked away I asked, ""Why did *they* tell us to kiss and not the priest?""

My wife answered,

The Ferrari is flat out, and there’s nothing he can do!

Suddenly, the moped plows into the back of his Ferrari, demolishing the rear end.

Donald thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil opened the door to the first room.

In it, was Richard Nixon and a  large pool of water. Nixon kept diving in, and surfacing, empty handed.
 
Over, and over, and over he dived in and surfaced with nothing. Such was his fate in  hell.

""No,"" Donald said. ""I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and it would ruin my hair. I don't think I could do that all day  long.”

The devil led him to the door of the next room. In it, was Ronald Reagan with a sledge-hammer and a room full of rocks.
 
All he did was swing that  hammer, time after time after time. ""No, this is no good; I've got this problem with my shoulder.”
 
“I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day”, commented Donald.

The devil opened a third door.
 
Through it, Donald saw Bill Clinton, lying on the bed, his arms tied over his head, and his legs restrained in a spread-eagle pose.
 
Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.
 
Donald looked at this in shocked disbelief, and finally said, ""Yeah man, I can handle this.""

The devil smiled and said, “Okay: Monica, you're free to go.""

So he takes her up on it and it’s amazing. He’s absolutely drained for a month. Now he’s obsessed and he has to go back.
