CONFESSION: #47881 If someone is pissed off the last thing you should do is write a program that tells them their internet connection is unstable.
COMMENT: Your Internet connection is unstable.

CONFESSION: #47880 This is so annoying bro the 18.06 midterm was the one of the only midterms where I feel like i could have aced it if I had an extra 15-20 minutes. Like I actually knew how to do everything but I couldn't get it all down, guess I gotta hold this
COMMENT: <tag> wow I remember this class
COMMENT: <tag> feels

CONFESSION: #47879 I went to NYC over the long weekend and I did report it on covidpass. I also got the vaccine months ago (I was part of the clinical trials). So yeah, hate me if you want, but I did this because after a year in Cambridge I needed to see other places were still there. I did the standard process to report a travel while following all other public health recommendations. I've been vaccinated for months but I still wear my mask.
COMMENT: weird flex, but ok. hope you enjoyed NYC, OP.

CONFESSION: #47878 My time at MIT is ending and I have many regrets. I wished I tried for that dance group or sing up for makers space or try living in a different dorm or spent more time meeting people at parties and events. I have good friends, but I never reached beyond my small friends group. Is it possible to still meet MIT students after graduation? I feel someone will say yes but realistically I feel the answer is no.
COMMENT: I would certainly like this too!
COMMENT: Different dorms and communities have different levels of tolerance for 'cruft'. It was also certainly easier to crash on a couch one year after graduating compared to, say, three. So depends on what exactly you decide you want to do now.
COMMENT: The difficulty in meeting people outside of school is you meet the same TYPE of people. You end up meeting more and more people inside your industry and fewer outside of it. You DONT need to meet more MIT people, but you DO need to continue to meet interesting people with a wide range of of opinions from different backgrounds.
COMMENT: There are alumni clubs around the world, some more active than others.

CONFESSION: #47877 The human body is topologically identical to a doughnut. Do with that information whatever you'd like.
COMMENT: <tag> wow ig we were just cannibals the night we walked around Boston looking for donuts ðŸ˜³

CONFESSION: #47875 how common are Harvard/MIT relationships? asking for a friend
